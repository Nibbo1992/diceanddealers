      <h2>Part I: The Grand Conjunction: A Primer for the Veteran Wargamer</h2>
      <p>
        This report serves as an exhaustive guide to Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Spearhead, designed specifically for players with a background in Warhammer 40,000. It aims to demystify the core mechanics of AoS, provide a detailed breakdown of the Spearhead game mode, and offer strategic advice to ensure a smooth transition and a competitive edge on the battlefield. The analysis begins by establishing a direct comparison between the two game systems, highlighting fundamental differences that influence tactical play.

      <h3>1.1 Welcome to the Mortal Realms: A Briefing on Spearhead</h3>
      <p>
        Spearhead is presented as a "fast and furious" and "simplest way to play" game mode for Warhammer Age of Sigmar, distinguished by its streamlined rules and remarkable tactical depth. It is built around pre-made, self-contained army boxes, a design choice that significantly lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers. A new player can acquire a single box and have everything needed to play, including all the models and their corresponding rules, without needing to delve into complex army composition or list-building. The game's design is not about simplifying the experience for the sake of it, but rather about streamlining the hobby to focus on core wargaming principles. The predetermined rosters ensure a balanced and fair fight right out of the box, as the Warhammer Studio has invested substantial effort in tailoring each force's rules to work cohesively and compete effectively against one another. This approach offers an evolved and more accessible experience than its predecessors.
      </p>

    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>1.2 A Tale of Two War Games: 40K vs. AoS</h3>
      <p>
        For a player transitioning from 40K, the most significant philosophical change is the shift from a shooting-first mentality to a melee-first one. While shooting units exist in AoS, the core of the game's strategic depth is built around close-quarters combat. This is reflected in the game's mechanics, which prioritize and reward aggressive, forward-moving play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attack sequence itself is a major point of departure. In AoS, the hit, wound, and save process is a series of independent rolls without the cross-referencing of Strength versus Toughness. An attacker first makes a hit roll of a D6, which must equal or beat the weapon's <strong>Hit</strong> characteristic. A successful hit is followed by a wound roll of a D6, which must meet or exceed the weapon's <strong>Wound</strong> characteristic. The defender then makes a save roll, subtracting the attacking weapon's <strong>Rend</strong> from the roll; a successful attack occurs if the result is less than the defending unit's Save characteristic. Unmodified rolls of 1 on any of these dice always fail. A key defensive mechanic for the transitioning player is the <strong>Ward Save</strong>. Unlike 40K's <strong>Invulnerable Save</strong>, which is a distinct value, a Ward Save is an additional save roll made after a successful attack has inflicted damage, with a successful roll removing the damage point from the unit's damage pool. This streamlined process accelerates gameplay and shifts the focus from complex calculations to tactical decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Movement and terrain mechanics also differ notably. AoS has a far more restrictive Coherency rule, where models in a unit must remain within ½" horizontally of another model. This forces units to maintain tight, dense formations, making a unit's physical footprint on the board a critical strategic factor. Conversely, the role of <strong>Verticality</strong> is greatly diminished. Unlike 40K, where elevation is key for line of sight and shooting bonuses, in AoS, models can simply move up and over terrain that is less than 1" in height, and taller terrain pieces largely serve as simple obstacles rather than tactical platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system of objective control is also simplified and more dynamic. A player gains control of an objective if the sum of the Control characteristics of their models within combat range is greater than that of their opponent. A key distinction from 40K is that objective control in AoS is "sticky"; once a player controls an objective, they maintain control until their opponent successfully contests it. This encourages a more mobile style of play. A player can secure an objective with a fast unit and then move that unit to a different part of the battlefield, knowing the objective is still theirs unless the enemy actively re-takes it. This removes the need for "camping" units on points, freeing up forces for more aggressive maneuvers and leading to a more fluid and engaging game.

      <h3>1.3 Spearhead vs. Combat Patrol: A Superior Starting Point</h3>
      <p>
        For the veteran 40K player, the question of whether to engage with Spearhead or stick with a familiar format like Combat Patrol is an important one. The community consensus is clear: Spearhead is a superior and more refined starting experience. This is not a coincidence; Spearhead was designed and released after Combat Patrol, allowing the development team to incorporate lessons from the earlier format's shortcomings. This iterative design process led to a game mode that is balanced by its foundational mechanics rather than by point costs alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core strength of Spearhead lies in its comprehensive and deliberate balance. Every faction's Spearhead box is an internally balanced force, with custom rules and warscrolls tailored specifically for the format. This is in contrast to the perceived issues with Combat Patrol, where some boxes were seen as poorly balanced or containing units that did not translate well to the skirmish format. In Spearhead, powerful units might be held in reserve to arrive later in the game, or less durable units might have the <strong>Reinforcements</strong> keyword, allowing them to return to the battle after being destroyed. These "catch-up" mechanics are woven into the game's fabric, ensuring close, nail-biting matches regardless of the initial army composition. The result is a game that is not only more enjoyable but also provides a more accurate preview of a faction's playstyle in full-scale AoS games, making it a better entry point into the hobby as a whole.

      <h2>Part II: The Sevenfold Path: Deconstructing the Spearhead Turn</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the flow of a game is paramount. Spearhead uses a well-defined turn and battle round structure, which is critical for new players to master.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>2.1 The Pre-Battle Sequence</h3>
      <p>
        A game of Spearhead begins with a pre-battle sequence that sets the stage for the entire match. Players first roll off, with the winner choosing to be either the Attacker or the Defender. The Attacker then chooses their <strong>Regiment Ability</strong> and a General Enhancement from the options provided in their army's rules. The Defender then makes their selections. This initial sequence is a crucial, high-stakes decision point. The Attacker can choose abilities to best suit their desired playstyle, such as an aggressive charge-focused approach. The Defender, on the other hand, can react to the Attacker's army and terrain placement, selecting abilities that directly counter their opponent's strengths. This pre-game dance requires foresight and adaptability, as the choices made here can profoundly impact the flow of the battle.

    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>2.2 The Battle Round: A Dance of Priority</h3>
      <p>
        A battle is composed of a fixed number of battle rounds, each containing two turns. At the start of the first battle round, the Attacker decides who takes the first turn. For subsequent rounds, players make a <strong>Priority Roll</strong> (a D6 roll-off), and the winner decides who takes the first turn. This is the source of the infamous "double turn" mechanic, where a player can potentially take two consecutive turns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spearhead's designers have addressed the traditional concerns about the double turn by implementing a significant trade-off. If a player wins the Priority Roll and chooses to go first after having gone second in the previous round, they do not draw any new Battle Tactic Cards for that round. This is a deliberate "catch-up" mechanism, designed to create a strategic dilemma. It forces a player to weigh the tactical advantage of a sudden burst of momentum against the loss of potential victory points from scoring a battle tactic. This makes the decision of taking a double turn a nuanced and calculated risk, rather than a simple game-winning gambit. The game is further balanced by the <strong>Underdog</strong> system, where the player with fewer victory points gains a bonus from the Twist card drawn at the start of the round.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>2.3 Phase by Phase: A Detailed Breakdown of Your Turn</h3>
      <p>
        Each turn is comprised of seven distinct phases, with the active player completing all of their phases before the inactive player takes their turn. The turn sequence is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Start of Turn Phase:</strong> This is where the Priority Roll takes place in rounds after the first. The Underdog is determined, and a Twist Card is drawn, applying a special condition to the battlefield that often benefits the trailing player. Objectives are also checked to see if the active player retains control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hero Phase:</strong> The simplified magic system of Spearhead comes into play here. Spells, known as Abilities in this mode, are cast by a unit with the <strong>Wizard</strong> keyword on a simple 2D6 roll, with the opponent able to attempt an <strong>Unbind</strong> with their own wizard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Movement Phase:</strong> During this phase, units can be moved up to their Move characteristic. The <strong>Run</strong> ability allows a unit not in combat to move a further D6" but prevents it from moving into combat. The <strong>Retreat</strong> ability allows a unit to move out of combat but inflicts D3 mortal damage. A key reactive ability to watch for is <strong>Redeploy</strong>, a command that allows an opponent to move one of their units up to D6" in response to your movement, potentially spoiling a charge or repositioning to an objective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shooting Phase:</strong> Units that have not Run or Retreated can use their ranged weapons to attack enemy units within range and line of sight. A unit cannot make shooting attacks if it is in combat, unless the weapon has the <strong>Shoot in Combat</strong> keyword.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Charge Phase:</strong> A unit that has not Run or Retreated can declare a Charge. A successful 2D6 <strong>Charge</strong> roll allows the unit to move up to the rolled value, and it must end within ½" of an enemy unit. A key tactical difference from 40K is that if a charge fails, the unit simply stays put, making the roll a high-stakes moment of commitment and risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combat Phase:</strong> This is where the turn structure truly diverges from 40K. Instead of an I-go-you-go format for the entire turn, the Combat Phase features alternating activations. The active player first uses any non-<strong>Fight</strong> abilities, followed by the inactive player. Then, players alternate picking units to use the <strong>Fight</strong> ability, with the active player choosing first. A unit can only <strong>Fight</strong> once per battle round.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End of Turn Phase:</strong> The final phase is where victory points are scored. The active player checks for control of objectives, scoring 1 VP for controlling at least one, 1 VP for controlling two or more, and 1 VP for controlling more objectives than their opponent. An additional victory point is scored for each <strong>Battle Tactic</strong> completed that turn.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>3.1 Understanding Your Arsenal: The Purpose of a Pre-Made Army</h3>
      <p>
        The self-contained nature of Spearhead boxes is a key feature of the game mode. Each army has a fixed list of units with specially written warscrolls, two <strong>Regiment Abilities</strong>, and four Enhancements for the general. This design ensures that every army is viable and balanced without the need for additional purchases or complex list-building. The units are designed to work together, and a player's strategic skill lies in mastering the pre-determined synergies of their force and leveraging their specific strengths against an opponent.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>3.2 Mastering the Meta-Game: Battle Tactics and Commands</h3>
      <p>
        Spearhead's meta-game is deeply influenced by its unique card-based system for Battle Tactics and Commands. At the start of each battle round, players draw up to three <strong>Battle Tactic Cards</strong>. Each card offers a crucial choice: a player can either attempt to complete the <strong>Battle Tactic</strong> on the card to score a victory point or, at any time, use the powerful command printed on the card instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a profound tactical element that forces a continuous evaluation of immediate gain versus long-term scoring potential. A player may have a card for a Battle Tactic that would be difficult to complete this turn, so they might opt to use its powerful command, such as <strong>Redeploy</strong>, to gain a tactical advantage. This is a departure from 40K's <strong>Stratagems</strong>, which are simply a resource to spend. In Spearhead, the card system turns every turn into a high-stakes decision about resource allocation, forcing a player to weigh the aggression of a command against the ultimate goal of accumulating victory points. This choice is at the heart of the game's strategic depth and is a major component of skillful play.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>3.3 The Art of the Comeback: Reinforcements and Reserves</h3>
      <p>
        A critical self-balancing mechanic in Spearhead is the Reinforcements keyword, which allows a destroyed unit to return to the board once per game. This is not merely a numerical advantage; it is a powerful tactical tool for a player who is falling behind. The <strong>Call for Reinforcements</strong> ability allows a player to set up a destroyed unit "wholly within friendly territory, wholly within 6" of the battlefield edge" and not in combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ability provides a significant positional comeback mechanic. A unit that was wiped out on one side of the board can suddenly reappear on the other side, allowing a player to threaten an unguarded objective, screen their general, or counter-attack an over-extended enemy force. This makes victory point leads more tenuous and provides a trailing player with a genuine path to return to the game.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="guide-section">
      <h3>3.4 First Game Tips for the 40K Convert: A Quick Reference</h3>
      <p>
        To help a 40K player navigate their first games of Spearhead, a few key points are worth remembering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Abandon the "I-Go-You-Go" Mindset:</strong> The game's turn structure is more interactive, particularly in the Combat Phase where players alternate activating units. Be prepared for your opponent to react to your moves in every phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus on Objectives, Not Just Kills:</strong> While destroying enemy units is satisfying, the game is won by accumulating victory points, not by tabling your opponent. Prioritize holding objectives and completing <strong>Battle Tactics</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Embrace the Unexpected:</strong> The Priority Roll and Twist Cards are designed to create a "dynamic" and "unpredictable" game. Rather than seeing these as frustrating random elements, a player should view them as opportunities for skill expression and adaptability, as they are designed to give an underdog a fighting chance.
        </li>
      </ul>
