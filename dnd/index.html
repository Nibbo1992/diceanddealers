      Black Dragon
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Lore:
      </strong>
      The Black Dragon is a swamp-dwelling tyrant, infamous for its cruel and malevolent nature. It revels in the suffering of others, often toying with its victims before delivering a final, brutal strike. It claims its territory by poisoning the land with its corrosive breath and lording over the boggy ruins of its conquests, where it hoards the sunken treasures of its slain foes. Unlike other chromatic dragons, it prefers to operate from the shadows, striking from ambush rather than engaging in a direct, fiery confrontation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Painting Guide:
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Start with a jet black basecoat for the main body, ensuring all scales are covered.
      <br/>
      Use a deep, muted grey to apply highlights to the raised areas of the scales, shoulders, and head to define the form without making the dragon look too light.
      <br/>
      Apply a dark green wash over the entire model to settle into the recesses, giving the scales a swampy, aged quality.
      <br/>
      For the acid effects, use a pale, almost neon green paint. Start with the mouth and claws, and then thin the paint with water to create trails of corroding liquid running down the scales.
      <br/>
      Finally, paint the eyes a vibrant yellow to make them stand out from the dark head, giving the dragon a sinister, watchful look.
