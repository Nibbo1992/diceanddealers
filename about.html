<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
        Welcome to <strong>Dice and Dealers</strong>, a haven for gamers and a community built on the roll of a die and the flip of a card. 
        Formed in 2025, our club is a safe and comfortable space where everyone—from the youngest aspiring hero to the most seasoned veteran—can find a place at our table. We believe in the magic of storytelling, the thrill of competition, and the unbreakable bonds forged over a shared love for the hobby.

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>

            <h4>Aiden <br> <strong>Website Geek & Code Monkey</strong></h4>
            <p>I’ve been a lore nerd for years, but it took until early 2024 for me to stop watching from the sidelines and finally dive into the 40K hobby. I'm a proud member of the glorious green tide, painting my beloved Orks—I can’t get enough of their ramshackle and cobbled-together designs. I'm the newest to the group when it comes to playing, but I've been loving the community side of the hobby. When I'm not on the tabletop, you'll find me behind a screen, as I'm the one who developed this website from the ground up!</p>

        <div class="team-member">

            <h4>Jamie <br> <strong>Other Club Games & New Ideas</strong></h4>
            <p>My earliest memories of wargaming date back to my school days, when a friend and I would sit together and sketch simple battle lines on pieces of paper. We’d take turns describing the actions of our units, creating improvised battles using only our imaginations.

It was during this time that a teacher introduced me to Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, which sparked a long-standing interest in both board games and PC gaming. Since then, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for strategy games in all their forms.

Today, my main focus is Warhammer 40,000. After moving to Nottingham over ten years ago, I rekindled my passion for the hobby, especially after connecting with Kalon and a group of friends who shared the same enthusiasm.

The idea of starting a local gaming group came about after I found myself regularly traveling across Nottingham just to get games in. I realised there was little visibility or local support for the hobby in our area—even if something existed, it wasn’t well known or promoted. That gap inspired us to create a community space closer to home, and we’ve been growing ever since.</p>

            <img style="width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 50%;" src="team/KalonPicture.JPG" alt="Picture of Kalon">
            <h4>Kalon <br> <strong>All things Wargames</strong></h4>
            <p>So where to start, I've been wargaming for over 20 years, playing a range of games from multiple different creators. My main games are Horus Heresy 30K and due to relentless pressure now 40K as well. I also love a range of board games and video games too, basically if you can't find me i'll be at my PC or painting desk. I'm a font of lore knowledge, 3D prints and painting tips, and happy to help people with anything (Especially beating Jamie at games)</p>

            <h4>Tom <br> <strong>Events & Terrain Guy, Admin & Code Monkey</strong></h4>
            <p>I’ve been part of the wargaming hobby for over 

20 years, both as a dedicated player and through my work in the tabletop industry. Over the years, I’ve marched armies across the battlefields of 

Warhammer Fantasy Battles/The Old World, fought galaxy-shaping campaigns in The Horus Heresy, and clashed in the realms of Middle-earth and Age of Sigmar: Spearhead. I've also always been a lover of history, so I dived deep into wargaming the black powder era, the 

Cold War, and WW2. When I’m not gaming, I’m usually at the hobby desk, crafting terrain or adding new units to one of my many vast armies, always looking to bring fresh life and character to the tabletop.</p>

<h2>Our Club Philosophy and Values</h2>
<p>
        The Dice & Dealers Club is built on the belief that tabletop gaming is more than just a hobby—it's a community. We believe in:
      </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: Our club is a safe and comfortable space for everyone, from new players to seasoned veterans, regardless of age, background, or skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: We are a community that values the magic of storytelling and the thrill of a shared narrative, whether you're embarking on a quest in D&D or leading an army into battle in Warhammer.</li>
<li><strong>Community over Competition</strong>: While we love a good, competitive game, we also believe in the unbreakable bonds that are forged over a shared love for the hobby. The goal is to "get it on the table" and have fun.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: The process of collecting, assembling, and painting miniatures is a core part of our hobby. We celebrate the journey from unpainted plastic to a personal, painted army and believe that a painted miniature is always better than an unpainted one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Club Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Respectful</strong>: We are an inclusive community for all gamers. Any form of bullying, harassment, or discrimination will not be tolerated.</li>
<li><strong>Community over Competition</strong>: Please remember that our main goal is to have fun and "get it on the table." Be a good sport and help out new players.</li>
<li><strong>Supervise Your Children</strong>: This club is a community, but it is not a daycare facility. For the safety and enjoyment of all members, all children under the age of 16 must be actively supervised by a parent or guardian at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Protect the Models</strong>: Please be mindful of other players' miniatures and belongings. Do not touch or move another person's models without their explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Tidy Up</strong>: Let's work together to keep the club space clean. Please be sure to clean up your play area and pack away any borrowed equipment after each session.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate Your Games</strong>: For a smooth club night, please use our online community to arrange your games beforehand. This ensures everyone has a game lined up and prevents any disappointment.</li>
<li><strong>The Hobby is for Everyone</strong>: We celebrate all parts of the hobby, from unboxing to painting. We encourage creativity, but there is never any expectation that your miniatures must be painted. Bring what you have and have fun!</li>
<li><strong>Play Fair</strong>: We believe in honest and fair play. Know the rules of your game, be clear with your intentions, and always use official rules and errata.</li>
</ul>
